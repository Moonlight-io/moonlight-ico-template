# Overview

* Presale methods which support tiered vesting without blocking the accounts from additional purchase
* KYC whitelisting and participation groups with variable participation blockHeight and allocations
* Immediate token minting upon purchase
* Multi-Stage vesting for founders allocation
* Contract Migration
* Presale allocation locking
* Partial refunds at hardcap
* Vested project token allocation

## Deployed
A deployed example of this contract can be found on Neo Testnet at `eac77fffef895a3bc90ca97437f30f9794e007da`



# Quickstart
1. Ensure that you correctly set `InitialAdminAccount` to your own address
2. [Build](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/quickstart/getting-started-csharp.html) and [deploy](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/quickstart/deploy-invoke.html) the contract with input params: `07`
2. Upon deployment you need to run the InitSmartContract administration method (can only be run once)
    * `main("admin", ["InitSmartContract"])`
    * **Note:** This is a latching method and cannot be undone
3. Allocate presale purchase amounts
    * `main("admin", ["AllocatePresalePurchase", hash160Recipient, tokenAmountFactorised]`
4. Lock future presale allocation
    * `main("admin", ["LockPresaleAllocation"])`
    * **Note:** This is a latching method and cannot be undone
5. Public method to ensure transparent use of `AllocatePresalePurchase`
    * `main("IsPresaleAllocationLocked", [])`


# Wallet Integration
- Check if a user has been whitelisted
    - > bool main("crowdsale_status", (hash160)address)
- Get the participation group number for the whitelisted user
    - > int main("GetGroupNumber", (hash160)address)
- Get the max number of LX the group can purchase
    - > int main("GetGroupMaxContribution")
- Get the block number the group can start participating
    - > int main("GetGroupUnlockBlock")
- Determine if the specified group number can now purchase tokens
    - > bool main("GroupParticipationIsUnlocked", (int)groupNumber)
* **Note:** `Group` refers to the phase of the sale a user can participate in.
